- ALthogh can be used to monitor non containerized infra
- but over the past years main stream monitoring tool of choice in containers and microservices architecture

WHY?
Moderm devops is becoming more and more complex with lenthy CICD pipe lines that have services strictly dependent on one anothger
where in failure of one service can lead a huge disaster 
So when application is down and you need to figure out quickly that among thousands of pods which one is exactly having error
Monitoring is very useful

SCenario
One of the servers went low on memory and kicked off a running conatiner that was responsible for 
providing database sync btw two database pods 
= two database failed
Application cannot authenbticate users 
= end users will only see unable to authenticate error 

So now we will check everythging backwards which will take a lot of time

BUt what would make this process faster is if we had a continous monitoring tool
that would tell us that a particular pod jhas crashed
or even better if it could tell that the server might be low on memory
