PENDING STATE

“Pending” status for a Pod means that the Pod has been accepted by the K8s system, but it hasn’t been scheduled for running on a node yet

REASONS
- resource crunch
- taint and tolerations
- node affinity
- pvc : if pod is dependent on PV and the pv is not ready 
- init container
- image pull back error
- Kubescheduler ka pod that is on master node is not running


TROUBLESHOOTING

check events
check pod logs
check scheduler pod logs
check node affinity taint and tolerations pvc image name 



CRASH LOOP BACK

Insufficient resources—lack of resources prevents the container from loading
Locked file/database/port—a resource already locked by another container
No proper reference/Configuration—reference to scripts or binaries that are not present on the container or any misconfiguration on underlying system such as read-only filesystem
Config loading/Setup error—a server cannot load the configuration file or initial setup like init-container failing
Connection issues—DNS or kube-DNS is not able to connect to a external services
Downstream service – One of the downstream services on which the application relies can’t be reached or the connection fails (database, backend, etc.)
Liveness probes– Liveness probes could have misconfigured or probe fails due to any reason.
Port already in use: Two or more containers are using the same port, which doesn’t work if they’re from the same Pod
